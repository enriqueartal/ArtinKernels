# ArtinKernels
In this notebook, we present functions to compute the homology of an Artin Kernel, following 
the paper 
*Module structure of the homology of right-angled Artin kernels*, 
by E. Artal, J.I. Cogolludo, D. Matei and S. LÃ³pez de Medrano, to appear in *Algebr. Geom. Topol.* and 
available at [`arxiv`:2002.00279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00279).

If you have access to a `Sagemath` installation, you can download the files. It is possible to check them online via binder
